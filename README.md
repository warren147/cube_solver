## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Python3<br>
Download Python3 [here]([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

Make sure you have Kociemba installed
'pip3 install kociemba'


## Executing Program

Download the code to your local device. Then, run the "main.py" file to open the GUI. 

## Inspiration

Ever since I was young, I’ve had a strong interest in solving Rubik’s cubes. Over the years, I’ve often found myself teaching others how to solve them. However, many people find the process confusing due to the complexity and multistep nature of solving a Rubik’s cube, which can be difficult to remember. This inspired me to create a project that specifically outlines the steps to help others solve the Rubik’s cube more easily.

## Future Development

Expand the Rubik’s cube to include 4x4 and other higher-dimensional versions, as well as different shapes. Enhance the user interface for a more polished appearance. Add new features such as tutorials and a 3D view.
